This API was created to make predictions for patients at high risk of chronic depression. To integrate it with the frontend, please connect the app.py file with the URL of the frontend stored in the "classification" repository in my profile. Additionally, to complete the setup, replace the URL in app/API/route.ts with the URL of your backend server provider, or define the URL as an environment variable.
